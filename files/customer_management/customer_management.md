Customer Management
===================

Splynx has an advanced customer management system. Each customer can have their own billing settings, where you as the administrator can define when to charge the customer or disconnect them, which payment method they prefer and other individual parameters.

Customers can have multiple types of services - _Bundle_, _Internet_, _Voice_ and _Custom_. The access information like PPP username/password, IP addresses, Router information, MAC address is also defined in the Services section of the customer. You can also generate/upload documents such as an agreement, installation document etc.
