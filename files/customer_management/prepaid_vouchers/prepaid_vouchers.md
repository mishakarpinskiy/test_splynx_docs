Prepaid vouchers
==========

Within the Splynx core we have a powerful Radius server which provides different types of services to end users. One of our popular services is hotspot access for hotels, conference halls etc.

Splynx can used to provide hotspot access to regular customers or to generate prepaid vouchers for one time access. Pictures with examples of how to generate customized prepaid vouchers are shown below.

You can define voucher prices, download and upload speed, and traffic limit. Once vouchers are generated, you can edit and customize each voucher individually and set up the contact details of customers using the cards.

Each voucher has its own statistics, charge of usage and detailed information:

Configuration of Hotspot for prepaid vouchers can be found in the [Radius hotspot configuration page](networking/authentication_users/mikrotik_hotspot_radius/mikrotik_hotspot_radius.md).
