Deals

Deals are commitments/agreements created with leads on business done with/for them.

These are created within the specific lead's page under the **Deals** tab.

Once you have selected to add a deal, it is necessary for you to fill in the required information in the fields provided:

* `Name of deal` - Best practice is to create a descriptive name for the deal.
* `Status` - Whether the deal is Open, Won or lost.
* `Owner` - The administrator to whom the deal belongs to/is responsible for.
* `Total` - The total value estimated that the deal will generate.
* `Created` - The date the deal is/was created (by default today's date)
* `Expected close` - The date that the deal is expected to close by/quote accepted and requests service activation.
* `Type` - Is the deal new, or existing business?
* `Source` - The source of where the deal was discovered by the lead eg. TV ad, newspaper, billboard etc.

Once the deal is added, it will also be added to the totals tab, which will provide us with a summary of all deals made with the customer.

We can also use the filter options to filter between the different status' the deals belong to.

All deals can viewed under the Deals Menu - here we can also search for deals via Period, Partner or via the search field.
