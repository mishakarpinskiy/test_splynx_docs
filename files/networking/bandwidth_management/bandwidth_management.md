Bandwidth management
==========

Splynx has a powerful bandwidth management engine. Software can set the speed limitation for customers on different vendors using Radius protocol or you can achieve advanced bandwidth management with HTB Queuing system of Mikrotik Router OS. We manage Queues on Mikrotik router using API. Please, read the following articles related to bandwidth management:
