Import
======

When you are migrating to Splynx, Import of customer database is probably needed. We provide the service of Import as a part of support for paid licenses, but you can also check how the Import is implemented in our system. Upload a csv/excel file, define columns as fields in the system and click upload, thatâ€™s all!
