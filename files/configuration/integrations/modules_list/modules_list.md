Modules list
=====

![icon](icon.png)

Here you can configure addons what you installed before.

For example I have installed Cashdesk and GoCardless-RB addons.

To configure these add-ons navigate to Config/Modules list:

![list](list.png)

Here module can be edited, removed and entry points can be configured(if an addon has entry points).

Let's edit Cashdesk addon:

![edit](edit_module.png)

Please do not change **API SETTINGS** if you are not sure what it is. After making changes don't forget to click "Save".

Now i want to enable entry points for customer's portal. Let's back to modules list and click on "Entry points":

![entry points](entry_points.png)

Our recommendation is not to change any configurations here except of enable/disable entry point. If you are going to use entry points on portal make sure that in module configuration this option is enabled:

![enable](enable_entries.png)

Now when entry points for portal are enabled let's see how it looks:

![portal1](portal1.png)

![portal2](portal2.png)

Customer can pay invoice from portal directly.
