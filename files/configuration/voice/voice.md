Voice processing
================

Voice processing allows administrator to upload different CDR files for Voip, Mobile or landline voice services. Splynx processes the CDR files and send calls to customer's statistics. So transaction is created from the voice statistics and one common invoice can be created for Internet, Voice and other services. Please note that for CDR processing CDR should include the final price of each single call or SMS or data unit. It means that you should upload already rated CDR files.
