Reminders
=============


Payment Reminders are the same as Prepaid Notifications. The only difference is that Payment Reminders are used in Recurring billing and Prepaid Notifications in Prepaid Billing. Payment reminder is an email, SMS or email+SMS prompt sent to customers to make them pay for their due or overdue invoice.

To set up sending Payment Reminders go to `Config → Finance → Reminders`.
