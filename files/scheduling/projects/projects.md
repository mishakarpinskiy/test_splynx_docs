Projects
======
The main sub module of the scheduling module, displaying a list of all your projects at hand. With each project representing how many tasks it consists of,
how many are in progress and the number of tasks already done for the project. **Reminder**: Just like all lists in Splynx, the data displayed can be customized
to your preference by using the breadcrumbs icon at the bottom of each list. ![Content icon](content_icon.jpg)

A new or existing project can be added/reviewed at `Scheduling > Projects`. To add a new project we need to press the **Add** button in the top right corner.
