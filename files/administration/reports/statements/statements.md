In this section, we can view a report of customer financial statements specifically regarding transactions and invoices VS payments. The report is represented in a table format and specifically displays data specified in the filter criteria. Therefore, it is necessary to specify which kind of report you wish to display, being either transactions or invoices/payments. Simply use the filter located at the top right of the table to select a period and the type of data to display, then click on show:

Upon clicking on "Show" the data will be retrieved according to your criteria:

![show_invoice_payments](show_invoice_payments.png)

You can then filter the data to display results pertaining to a specific partner and/or location, or a specific customer, or even a customer category.

![generate_for_some_customer](generate_for_some_customer.png)

and here is the result for single customer:

Once you have filtered the table/report to display data of your preference, you can then download a PDF copy of the report/table with the use of the "Generate PDF" button located within the filter. Once generated, two options will become available:

1. **Download generated** - download the result in PDF format;

2. **Send to customers** - send the statement to each customer in this list.  

On the tab _FINANCE CUSTOMERS REPORT_  you can generate a simpler finance report:
