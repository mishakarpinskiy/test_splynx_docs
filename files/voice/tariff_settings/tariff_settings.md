Tariff Settings
===============

We have introduced new settings on the tariff config, which allows to add included pricing and group pricing to the tariff, and also a preview tool for test. You also have to choose on which rate table will be based that tariff and in case we are managing buy prices(prices from our providers) we can add an increase percentage to define the final sell price.

On Tariffs Plans → Voice, click on the symbol <icon class="image-icon">![ViewIcon1](./icon1.png)</icon> pricing to configure settings.

It has 2 windows Groups and Preview.

On the window Groups, we have 3 boxes. In the first one we have to set the Rate table and the Buy price increase in %.

####Preview Tool

We can set an example of comsuption to test if our setting and config are working well.

![Preview Tool](./preview_tool.png)

The preview is showing that is included only 6000sec(100min), and as we have set 7000sec, the other 1000 seconds will be charged in base to the table, so total price is 1'17, that correspond to out config in the Rate table selected.
