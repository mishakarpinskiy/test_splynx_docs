Proforma invoices
==========

**Pro-forma Invoice** is an abridged or estimated invoice sent by a seller to a buyer in advance of delivery of servives/goods. It notes the kind and quantity of services/goods, their value, and other important information. Proforma invoices are commonly used as preliminary invoices with a quotation, or for customs purposes in importation. They differ from a normal invoice in not being a demand or request for payment.

In our billing system Proforma Invoice can be used as a request of payment in advance. For example, it can be created 1 month before the occuring payment, so you will see if customer is able to pay the Proforma Invoice. When proforma invoice is created, the customer’s balance hasn't changed. The main reason for this billing approach is to prevent the payment of VAT tax for non-paying customers. If the customer pays the amount specified in the Proforma Invoice PDF, the company can issue a tax Invoice.

An example of this document is shown in the picture below:
