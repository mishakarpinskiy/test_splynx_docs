Payments
==========


Splynx processes payments. When customer pays cash at your company office, the cash desk module can be used to enter payments into the system. The cash desk operator’s access is limited: he can only accept, enter payments and view customers’ details. The administrator can add cash payments into the system as well.

ISPs usually have different payment methods; Splynx supports bank transactions or generation of SEPA payment orders and also wide range of payment gateways.


**Payments' table** in Finance module displays all different types of payments for a particular period of time according your choice.
You can also range them by Partner. Under the list of Payments will be a table called *"Totals"*, which will display all types of payments for a particular period of time with number of payments in each type and amount of money in each type.
