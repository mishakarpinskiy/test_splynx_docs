Voice plans
===========

**Why use Voice plans in Splynx?**

There are two main reasons for voice plans :

1. Charging clients monthly fee for voice services such as VOIP, Toll number, Number rental or Mobile plan.
2. Processing of VOIP CDR. Splynx is able to auto or manual process the CDR from Voice platforms, attach calls from CDRs to proper customer, create transaction for voice usage and make one common invoice for Voice services and Internet.

To configure the Voice plan, click on _Tariff plans → Voice_ and click on _Add plan_.
